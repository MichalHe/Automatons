This is my implementation of algorithms working with pressburger arithmetics using finite automatons.

### TODO
- [x] build nfa to solve inequalities over Z
- [x] analyze formulas to get information about the equation/inequation:
- [x] Free variables
- [x] Absolute part of the formula
- [x] variable coeficients vector
- [X] Test whether projection produces correct symbol maps
- [X] implement automaton intersection
- [X] implement variable projection (quantifiers)
- [x] solve final state uniqueness when merging automatons
- [X] Implement multiplication operation in the equation evaluation.
- [X] test, wheter parser recognizes variable coefs expressions correctly
- [X] make advanced tests for automaton union
- [ ] make advanced tests for automaton intersection
- [ ] make advanced tests for automaton projection
- [ ] solve first formula :)


# Problems
- [ ] union/intersection over different NFAs with different alphabets
- [ ]
