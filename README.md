This is my implementation of algorithms working with pressburger arithmetics using finite automatons.

### TODO
- [x] build nfa to solve inequalities over Z
- [x] analyze formulas to get information about the equation/inequation:
- [x] Free variables
- [x] Absolute part of the formula
- [x] variable coeficients vector
- [ ] implement automaton intersection
- [ ] implement variable projection (quantifiers)
- [ ] solve final state uniqueness when merging automatons
- [ ] test, wheter parser recognizes variable coefs expressions correctly
- [ ] solve first formula :)
